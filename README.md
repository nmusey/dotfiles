# dotfiles
Setting things up the way I like it. I plan on having some scripts to setup new environments automatically too.

I'm currently using [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to link all my dotfiles to their appropriate locations.

## Prerequsite programs
- `zsh`
- `neovim`
- `stow`
- `antidote`
- `git`

I'd like to learn how to use `tmux` as well but haven't set it up yet.

## Todo
* Finish setting up Neovim plugins
  * I need LSP plugins for languages I use
  * Gitsigns needs to be setup
  * More plugins once I figure out what I miss from other editors
* Setup a git config
