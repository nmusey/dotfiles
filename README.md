# dotfiles
Setting things up the way I like it. I plan on having some scripts to setup new environments automatically too.

I'm currently using [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to link all my dotfiles to their appropriate locations.

## Configured programs
- `zsh`
- `neovim`
- `stow`
- `antidote`

I'd like to learn how to use `tmux` as well but haven't set it up yet.

## Usage
Install scripts exist for MacOS and Ubuntu (or any Ubuntu based distros). Just clone the repo and run `setup.sh {macos,ubuntu}` to install.

## Todo
* Configure a `languages.vim` file with language plugins
* Setup a git config
* Setup an install script for Arch-based distros
